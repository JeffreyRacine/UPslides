# Quarto: Technical, Reproducible Documents

## A Sub-Optimal Workflow

- The old way of doing research is to run your analyses using R, then to manually copy figures and tables into a word processor (e.g., MS Word) or typesetter (e.g., $\rm\TeX$) 

- So you end up maintaining separate code, figures, and narrative files and being their go-between coordinator

- And you have pre-committed to an output format!

- Then you find a code or data error and need to redo figures, tables, etc., or need to change output formats

- This is a brutally inefficient and error prone process because it requires a go-between (i.e., you!)

## A Streamlined Workflow

- Quarto places your code and narrative into the same file

- Relieved of coordination duties, new possibilities emerge

  - you now *automatically* refer to analytical results

  - you now *conditionally* describe analytical results
  
- If code or data is updated, figures and tables are automatically updated in your output document

- Perhaps best of all, your Quarto file can be *rendered* into any imaginable output format seamlessly via <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a>

- (<a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>, <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href=https://rstudio.github.io/renv>renv</a> are all supported in <a href="https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/">RStudio</a>)

# Summary

- We have barely scratched the surface and have skipped technical details

- However, you now have some perspective and have access to modern tools

- You can consult @racine_2019 if you wish to go deeper (detailed proofs, R code, examples etc.)

- Many of the links in these slides may also be useful

- You may contact me at <a href="mailto:racinej@mcmaster.ca">racinej\@mcmaster.ca</a>

- It has been my pleasure to guide you!
